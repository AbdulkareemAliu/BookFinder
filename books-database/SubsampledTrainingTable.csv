86,sidelights on relativity,albert einstein,"in 1905, a german technical journal, annalen der physik, published a remarkable paper by a young clerk in the patent office at berne, switzerland. the clerk was albert einstein. the paper outlined his special theory of relativity, a revolutionary physical theory which discarded the concept of absolute motion in favor of relative motion in the context of a four-dimensional continuum of space-time. it proved to be the most profound revolution in physics since newton.about ten years later, building on his earlier work, einstein formulated the general theory of relativity in which he offered a new solution to the great problem of gravitation, postulating the non-euclidean character of the space-time continuum. together, the two theories constituted a radically reoriented way of looking at the physical universe, an approach that solved many of the unresolved difficulties of classical mechanics and paved the way for great advances in 20th-century physics. this concise volume contains two addresses by dr. einstein outlining aspects of the theories. ether and relativity (1920), delivered at the university of leyden, discusses the properties demanded of the ether of space by the theory of relativity. geometry and experience (1921), given at the prussian academy of sciences, describes the limits within which the euclidean or any other practical geometric system can be held to be approximately true in connection with the concept of a finite universe.both lectures are reprinted here complete and unabridged; both express elegant ideas in simple prose devoid of complicated equations or abstruse terminology; both offer scientists and laypeople unparalleled insight into the seminal thinking of the 20th century's greatest physicist.","mathematics , geometry , general"

""we can't afford to keep ignoring or underestimating the invasion,"" writes robert devine as he takes the measure of this extraordinary ecological assault, explaining where alien species come from, how they establish their beachheads and expand, why they seem so much hardier than the indigenous species they displace, and what we can do to neutralize them. a fascinating and informative book that ranges from hawaii to florida, alien invasion combines state-of-the-art environmental science with vivid personal stories of the impact of exotics, from a firefighter's gripping tale of a fatal cheatgrass blaze to an eerie boat ride through an everglades grove where all other life has been choked out by a foreign tree.","science , environmental science"

208,wastrels of defense: how congress sabotages u.s. security,winslow t. wheeler,"in this damning expose, a veteran senate defense advisor argues that since sept 11, 2001, the conduct of the u.s. congress has sunk to new depths and endangered the nation's security. winslow wheeler draws on three decades of work with four prominent senators to tell in lively detail how members of congress divert money from essential war-fighting accounts to pay for pork in their home states, cook the budget books to pursue personal agendas, and run for cover when confronted with tough defense issues. with meticulous documentation to support his claims, he contends that this behavior is not confined to one party or one political philosophy. he further contends that senators who sell themselves as reformers and journalists covering capitol hill are simply not doing their jobs. pork is far from a new phenomenon in washington, yet most americans fail to understand its serious consequences. wheeler knows the harm it does and challenges citizens to take action against lawmakers pretending to serve the public trust while sending home the bacon. dubbed a ""hill deep throat"" who participated in the game he now criticizes, he fills his book with evidence of congressional wrongdoing, naming names and citing specific examples. pointing to the extremes that have become routine in the legislative process, he focuses on defense appropriations and congress's willingness to load down defense bills with pork, in some cases with the pentagon's help. on the question of deciding war, he accuses today's members of congress of lacking the character of their predecessors, often positioning themselves on both sides of the question of war against iraq without probing the administration's justifications. wheeler concludes with a model for reform that he calls twelve not-so-easy steps to a sober congress.","political science , law enforcement"

210,prodigal soldiers: how the generation of officers born of vietnam revolutionized the american style of war (an ausa institute of land warfare book),james kitfield,"the unprecedented display of prowess and efficiency in desert storm revealed a military unlike any the nation had ever seen before. from the disarray in the aftermath of vietnam to the ""be all that you can be"" campaign in the 1980s, the u.s. armed services did no less than reinvent themselves, with stunning results. in prodigal soldiers, james kitfield chronicles that remarkable revitalization of the military by following the lives of a unique generation of officers, the senior commanders who led the nation to victory in desert storm.there is colin powell, the nation's youngest and first african-american chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, whose epiphany on leadership came not in washington, d.c., but in the 1970s as a young commander in south korea in the midst of anarchy; chuck horner, the irreverent combat pilot who watched the air force fall into the habit of lying to itself in vietnam, and who was seemingly at the end of his career before being called on to lead the air war; barry mccaffrey, the infantryman wounded three times and nearly killed in vietnam, who went on to become gen. norman schwarzkopf's most aggressive division commander and the most highly decorated general in uniform; adm. stan arthur, the decorated naval aviator who had to temper the navy's fierce streak of independence to fight a joint-service war; and walt boomer, the laconic marine commander from tennessee whose own experience as a grunt in vietnam helped him to face an agonizing decision that seemed to pit the good of his beloved corps against the lives of his young marines.in a tightly woven narrative tracing the lives of these officers through three decades, kitfield reveals how their experiences as young men in vietnam changed forever their ideas about how wars should be fought and what is worth dying for. in the dark aftermath of vietnam marked by racial tension, drug abuse, and insubordination, each of the services confronted a demoralization within the ranks that threatened far more than the outcome of a single war. significant social upheavals, including the end of the draft and an increased reliance on the reserves, and integration of women into the ranks, also pulled the military into new and uncertain directions in the 1970s.tactics and training were revised as military leaders abandoned the old warfighting model of wearing an enemy down with industrial might in favor of a hotly debated strategy of gaining technological superiority and limiting casualties. visionary mavericks in uniform provoked congress to enact the most sweeping reorganization of military command structure in forty years, heralding an era of joint operations that drew synergy from the armed services.prodigal soldiers is the stirring tale of the american military's renewal and redemption.","political science , general"

242,the things that matter most,cal thomas,"with a growing readership that is outpacing that of all other political columnists, cal thomas now turns his attention to the tragic consequences of misguided liberal thinking, laying out a damning indictment that will surely provoke a lively national debate.the things that matter most is for people who wonder why social problems don't seem to go away, no matter how much money we pour into them...who think that families do matter, that fidelity does count, that fighting for one's country is noble...who long for a sense of purpose more transcendent than collecting another paycheck.with an objective, analytic eye, thomas traces our current national malaise - rampant disease, crime, and despair - to the false promises of the sixties. ironically, by topping all traditions; by declaring drugs and sex ""in"" and god ""out""; by promulgating a credo of ""it feels good, do it,"" the activists of that era triggered a process that produced the following: a widespread erosion of standards - most alarmingly in the area of education; a ""can you top this"" race to fill the media with ever cruder content; an explosive rise in sexual promiscuity and drug taking, leading to epidemic disease; the increasing rarity of the society-strengthening two-parent family; a spiritual vacuum that causes people to question why life is worth living; and a ""welfare pentagon"" whose enfeebling mantra is ""you can't do it alone.""mixing hard truths with wry commentary, cal thomas prescribes a new vision for america that begins with reconsidering the values by which our parents and grandparents lived. america may have lost its way, but it can regain it, thomas argues - in what will surely be one of the most important and talked-about books of the year.","social science , general"

244,a more perfect constitution: 23 proposals to revitalize our constitution and make america a fairer country,larry j. sabato,"""no society can make a perpetual constitution, or even a perpetual law. the earth belongs to the living generation.""—thomas jefferson""a constitution intended to endure for years to come [is] consequently to be adapted to the various crises of human affairs.""—john marshall""this book will ask readers to set aside their own political loyalties, to look past the current ‘values' debates and hot-button issues, to consider this very real possibility: that the failure of the nation to update the constitution and the structure of government it originally bequeathed to us is at the root of our current political dysfunction.""—larry sabatothe political book of the year, from the acclaimed founder and director of the center for politics at the university of virginia.larry sabato has one of the most visionary and fertile political minds in america. like so many, he is increasingly alarmed at the growing dysfunction and unfairness of our political system. to solve this, to restore the equity for ordinary citizens that is at the core of our democratic society, we must take a radical step—to revise the constitution, the document that guides our political process, for until some of its outmoded provisions are reformed, we will only have more of the same.the original framers fully expected the constitution to be regularly revised by succeeding generations to reflect the country's changing needs; yet, apart from the ten amendments in the bill of rights, it has only been amended 17 times in 220 years, and most of those amendments had minor ramifications. today, partisan gridlock dominates washington; 17 percent of voters elect a majority of senators; the presidency has assumed unprecedented and unintended powers; while politicians spend as much time campaigning for office as they do governing; and average americans feel more and more disconnected from the political process so that half or more don't vote in many elections—all of which would have horrified jefferson and madison.a more perfect constitution presents twenty three creative and dynamic proposals to reinvigorate american governance at a time when such change is urgently needed. combining idealism and pragmatism, and with full respect for the original document, sabato's thought-provoking ideas range from the length of the president's term in office and the number and terms of supreme court justices to the structure of congress, the vagaries of the antiquated electoral college, and a compelling call for universal national service—all laced through with the history behind each issue and their potential impact on the lives of ordinary people.aware that such changes won't happen easily, sabato urges us nonetheless to engage in the debate and discussion they will surely engender. as we head towards a presidential election year, no book is more relevant or significant than his.","political science , constitutions"

284,god and ronald reagan: a spiritual life,paul kengor,"ronald reagan is hailed today for a presidency that restored optimism to america, engendered years of economic prosperity, and helped bring about the fall of the soviet union. yet until now little attention has been paid to the role reagan's personal spirituality played in his political career, shaping his ideas, bolstering his resolve, and ultimately compelling him to confront the brutal -- and, not coincidentally, atheistic -- soviet empire.in this groundbreaking book, political historian paul kengor draws upon reagan's legacy of speeches and correspondence, and the memories of those who knew him well, to reveal a man whose christian faith remained deep and consistent throughout his more than six decades in public life. raised in the disciples of christ church by a devout mother with a passionate missionary streak, reagan embraced the church after reading a christian novel at the age of eleven. a devoted sunday-school teacher, he absorbed the church's model of ""practical christianity"" and strived to achieve it in every stage of his life.but it was in his lifelong battle against communism -- first in hollywood, then on the political stage -- that reagan's christian beliefs had their most profound effect. appalled by the religious repression and state-mandated atheism of bolshevik marxism, reagan felt called by a sense of personal mission to confront the ussr. inspired by influences as diverse as c.s. lewis, whittaker chambers, and aleksandr solzhenitsyn, he waged an openly spiritual campaign against communism, insisting that religious freedom was the bedrock of personal liberty. ""the source of our strength in the quest for human freedom is not material, but spiritual,"" he said in his evil empire address. ""and because it knows no limitation, it must terrify and ultimately triumph over those who would enslave their fellow man.""from a church classroom in 1920s dixon, illinois, to his triumphant mission to moscow in 1988, ronald reagan was both political leader and spiritual crusader. god and ronald reagan deepens immeasurably our understanding of how these twin missions shaped his presidency -- and changed the world.","political science , general"

359,the european dream,jeremy rifkin,"the american dream is in decline. americans are increasingly overworked, underpaid, and squeezed for time. but there is an alternative: the european dream-a more leisurely, healthy, prosperous, and sustainable way of life. europe's lifestyle is not only desirable, argues jeremy rifkin, but may be crucial to sustaining prosperity in the new era.     with the dawn of the european union, europe has become an economic superpower in its own right-its gdp now surpasses that of the united states. europe has achieved newfound dominance not by single-mindedly driving up stock prices, expanding working hours, and pressing every household into a double- wage-earner conundrum. instead, the new europe relies on market networks that place cooperation above competition; promotes a new sense of citizenship that extols the well-being of the whole person and the community rather than the dominant individual; and recognizes the necessity of deep play and leisure to create a better, more productive, and healthier workforce.   from the medieval era to modernity, rifkin delves deeply into the history of europe, and eventually america, to show how the continent has succeeded in slowly and steadily developing a more adaptive, sensible way of working and living. in the european dream, rifkin posits a dawning truth that only the most jingoistic can ignore: europe's flexible, communitarian model of society, business, and citizenship is better suited to the challenges of the twenty-first century. indeed, the european dream may come to define the new century as the american dream defined the century now past.","political science , political ideologies , democracy"

467,what liberal media?: the truth about bias and the news,eric alterman,"the question of whose interests the media protects—and how—has achieved holy-grail-like significance. is media bias keeping us from getting the whole story? if so, who is at fault? is it the liberals who are purported to be running the newsrooms, television and radio stations of this country, duping an unsuspecting public into mistaking their party line for news? or is it the conservatives who have identified media bias as a reliably inflammatory rallying cry around which to consolidate their political base as they cynically “work the refs?” the media has become so pervasive in our lives that regardless of exactly where on the ideological fence you sit, the question of media bias has become all but unavoidable.most of the criticism (and anger) has so far emanated from the political right, which has offered us the rather unconvincing argument that a systematic left bias is destroying the quality of news and debate in our country today. journalist and historian eric alterman begs to differ.what liberal media? confronts the question of liberal bias and, in so doing, provides a sharp and utterly convincing assessment of the realities of political bias in the news. in distinct contrast to the conclusions reached by ann coulter, bernard goldberg, sean hannity, and bill o’reilly, alterman finds the media to be, on the whole, far more conservative than liberal, though it is possible to find evidence for both views. the fact that conservatives howl so much louder and more effectively than liberals is one significant reason that big media is always on its guard for “liberal” bias but gives conservative bias a free pass. after reading what liberal media? you will understand that the real news story of recent years is not whether this newspaper, or that news anchor, is biased but rather to what extent the entire news industry is organized to communicate conservative views and push our politics to the right—regardless of how “liberal” any given reporter may be.","language arts and disciplines , journalism"

472,a guide to library research methods,thomas mann,"in this age of information explosion, job hunters, students, professionals and researchers have long needed a comprehensive yet user-friendly handbook to guide them through the bewildering maze of resources now available. this book, written by a reference librarian at the library of congress, introduces a distinctive, new approach to the fact-finding process. it provides an exceptional overview not only of the range of materials that exist, but, more importantly, of the several conceptual options that individuals have in using them.     dr. mann's problem-solving technique emphasizes seven different research methods that can be applied to any inquiry. these can be used as a set of easily remembered ""mental pegs"" that enables individuals to get further into a subject more quickly, and with less wasted effort. while using the more conventional research models that categorise sources by type-of-literature (dictionaries, almanacs, etc.) and by subject discipline (business, english, psychology, etc.), the author's approach enables individuals to pursue their inquiries in a cross-disciplinary and more thorough fashion. the seven research methods described include computer searches, subject heading inquiries, bibliographies, systematic browsing, key word searches and citation searches, and more. mann discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the several methods (for example, the pitfalls of relying exclusively on computer searches), the use of unique sources like the national union catalog, and the treasures to be found in frequently neglected sources like special collections, microform sets, and government documents. an invaluable feature of the book is its provision of numerous examples of actual searches, including examples of the mistakes and omissions that most people (even university professors) are guilty of, without ever realizing that they have gone off the best track.  library research methods should be required reading for every individual--whether scholar or journalist, law student or scientist--who has ever asked, ""where should i start to find out about this?""","language arts and disciplines , library and information science , general"

489,from alfred to henry iii; 871-1272,christopher brooke,"the 400 years covered by this volume saw two danish invasions and the norman conquest of england. each conquest carried with it extensive political and social changes. alfred began the work of creating a unified kingdom out of the shambles of the smaller kingdoms that had fallen under viking raids. the ninth and tenth centuries saw the settlement of the danes and the eleventh the emergence of a strong monarchy under the danish king cnut. ""with the english kingdom grew up the first semblance of national institutions,"" writes professor brooks--institutions of central and local government which made the english monarchy among the most mature in the europe of its time.... these established institutions were not destroyed by the normans; they adapted and developed them.although england had had close ties with the continent before the conquest, after 1066 english cultural and social life was greatly enriched through the french influence. during this time the church was finding new inspiration in monastic and papal reform and a great intellectual revival culminated in the creation of universities. professor brooke describes all the cultural and political developments of these years and shows how the reign of henry iii ushered in a ""great age of art and architecture"" and a ""new attitude to government,"" which began to work by consent of the governed.","language arts and disciplines , general"
490,the washington reporters,stephen hess,"in the vast literature on the way democratic governments work, the role of the press is often overlooked. yet the press, no less than the formal branches of government, is a public policy institution and deserves to be included in explanations of the governmental process.  in the washington reporters, stephen hess focuses on those who cover the u.s. government for the american commercial news media. his book is based on interviews with reporters and editors and on responses to questionnaires from nearly half of the over 1,200 american reporters in washington. analysis of these responses and comparison with the content and placement of over 2,000 of these reporters' news stories permit an unusual&#151;and sometimes startling&#151;perspective on washington newswork. mr. hess demonstrates, for instance, how information in the news regularly comes from the legislative branch of the government, despite the greater number of stories on the presidency; and he shows that washington news dominates the front pages of daily newspapers across the country, no matter how little may be going on in the nation's capital.  the author concludes that ""washington news gathering fragments [media] power, while at the same time it shifts decisions on what is news and how it should be covered to the reporters."" the import of this impression is that ""reporters are not simply passing along information; they are choosing, within certain limits, what most people will know about government. the freedom given and assumed by these news workers affects the shape of national affairs.""","language arts and disciplines , journalism"

507,sentinel under siege: the triumphs and troubles of america's free press,stanley e. flink,"if the unexamined life is not worth living, surely the unexamined media is not worth heeding. sentinel under siege traces the evolution of the media in the united states and its capacity to examine and regulate itself, from its earliest colonial roots to the modern explosion of digital technology.once the bill of rights was enacted in 1791, the press became the first and only enterprise explicitly protected by the united states constitution. this book is concerned with the legal content given to freedom of the press by the supreme court, and the fitful attempts of media criticism—both intramural and external—to build a greater sense of responsibility among the practitioners.stanley flink, former correspondent of life magazine and writer/producer at nbc and cbs, is concerned less with the people’s right to know than with the people’s need to know. only a competent, responsible press—whatever its means of distribution—can perform the role of watchdog over official abuse of power, business corruption, and political distortions. but the acquisition of so many newspapers, magazines, and broadcasting facilities by corporate conglomerates threatens a new kind of prior restraint on an independent press—the conflicts of interest; the power of advertising; the unspoken self-censorship of reporters and editors, print or electronic, based on the perceived predilections of their employers; and the financial interests of related companies.flink believes that responsible journalism can also be economically viable in the twenty-first century because the mass communication of reliable news reporting and media accountability will be vital to the democratic process. unless the news media persistently seeks the high moral ground of public service, the first casualty will be an informed electorate. the second may well be constitutional protection.","language arts and disciplines , journalism"

532,a theory of predicates (center for the study of language and information - lecture notes),"farrell ackerman, gert webelhuth","when studying linguistics, it is commonplace to find that information packaged into a single word in one language is expressed by several independent words in another language. this observation raises an important question: how can linguistics research represent what is the same among languages while accounting for the obvious differences between them? in this work, two linguists-farrell ackerman and gert webelhuth-from different theoretical paradigms develop a new general theory of natural language predicates. this theory is capable of addressing a broad range of issues concerning (complex) predicates, many of which remain unresolved in previous theoretical proposals. the book focuses on cross-linguistically recurring patterns of predicate formation. it also provides a detailed implementation of ackerman and webelhuth's theory for german tense-aspect, passive, causative, and verb-particle predicates. in addition, a discussion of the extension of these representative analyses to the same predicate construction in other languages is presented. beyond providing a formalism for the analysis of language-particular predicates, the authors demonstrate how the basic theoretical mechanism they develop can be employed to explain universal tendencies of predicate formation.","language arts and disciplines , grammar and punctuation"

(how about fauxcellarm, phonundrum, or pandephonium?)or what about a word for offspring who are adults? (try unchildren or offsprung.) or a word for the irrational fear when you're throwing a party that no one will show up?

""it did not allow them to turn today's imagination into tomorrow's fact. but it is just this power to transform imagination into fact that distinguishes human behavior from that of our ancestral species, and indeed from that of all other species. it is exactly what enables us to change our behavior, or invent vast ranges of new behavior, practically overnight, with no concomitant genetic changes.""language and human behavior should be of interest to anyone in the behavioral and evolutionary sciences and to all those concerned with the role of language in human behavior","language arts and disciplines , linguistics , general"

769,the number: a completely different way to think about the rest of your life,lee eisenberg,"do you know your number?what happens if you don't make it to your number?do you have a plan?the often-avoided, anxiety-riddled discussion about financial planning for a secure and fulfilling future has been given a new starting point in the number by lee eisenberg. the buzz of professionals and financial industry insiders everywhere, the number represents the amount of money and resources people will need to enjoy the active life they desire, especially post-career. backed by imaginative reporting and insights, eisenberg urges people to assume control and responsibility for their standard of living, and take greater aim on their long-term aspirations.in 1999, eisenberg was in the midst of downshifting from having served as the editor-in-chief of esquire and other high profile positions. he was ""half-in, half-out of the workplace"" with an enviable consulting position at time, inc., and a family comfortably settled in the suburbs. that's when he received an unexpected offer from the wisconsin-based lands' end which, in the end, he couldn't resist. it meant uprooting his family and moving to the rural heartland, and taking on the challenges of an entirely new way of life. before the move, he admits, ""i was worried about the number."" once in wisconsin, eisenberg confesses that the ""number was leading us around by our noses."" from wall street to main street usa, the number means different things to different people. it is constantly fluctuating in people's minds and bank accounts. to some, the number symbolizes freedom, validation of career success, the ticket to luxurious indulgences and spiritual exploration; to others, it represents the bewildering and nonsensical nightmare of an impoverished existence creeping up on them in their old age, a seemingly hopeless inevitability that they would rather simply ignore than confront. people are highly private and closed-mouthed when it comes to discussing their numbers, or lack thereof, for fear they might either reveal too much or display ineptitude. in the number, eisenberg describes this secret anxiety as the ""last taboo,"" a conundrum snared in confusing financial lingo. he sorts through the fancy jargon and translates the number into commonsense advice that resonates just as easily with the aging gods and goddesses of corporate boardrooms as it does with ordinary people who are beginning to realize that retirement is now just a couple of decades away. believing that the number is as much about self-worth as it is net worth, eisenberg strives to help readers better understand and more efficiently manage all aspects of their life, money, and pursuit of happiness.* according to eisenberg, ""number chasers"" fall into four personality types: --""procrastinators"" enter their forties and fifties ensconced in a cloud of avoidance and denial about the years ahead of them, or simply do not understand investing in their futures. --""pluckers"" often lazily or arrogantly pull ephemeral, albeit specific, numbers from thin air with little attention to developing a realistic and coherent plan to achieve their goals. --""plotters"" crunch every practical aspect of their financial history, hoping to cement their number in black and white, even at the expense of not having fun and leisure.--""probers"" visualize their numbers not as an end but as the means to pursuing dreams and passions, and completing inner and outer journeys to self-fulfillment.* the current ""debt warp"" is the ""silent number killer that afflicts young and old"" that has been brought on by our ""whip-it-out credit-card culture.""* the ""lost years"" describes a person's 20s, 30s, and 40s wherein sensible financial foundation-building bows to oblivious and careless spending, and the tug-of-war dichotomy between the ""old rest of your life"" and the ""new rest of your life.""* a surprise ""lifestyle relapse"" attack around retirement age can be induced by debt, aging, long term care, and self-absorption. living longer and spending more, people will eventually experience dire consequences in response to the debt-drenched, expense account-driven lifestyles to which they have grown accustomed.* the six tenets of the ""eisenberg uncertainty principles"" outline the dubious state of living in a carpe diem-addicted, indebted culture with little financial guidance or responsibility. * ""downshifting"" is an important skill one needs to know how to do in the expanse between leaving a career and before death in order to maintain financial stability and a happy life.eisenberg's book is not an investment guide, but rather something wholly original: a revealing look behind our most common financial and emotional conflicts and how we can begin to get a grip on them. eisenberg gives each reader a unique and unprecedented tool with which to virtually craft his or her future. this encompassing book is a priceless, step-by-step prelude to initiating, or continuing, discussions with a qualified financial advisor. the bottom line for the number is that eisenberg offers each reader a fresh and promising beginning to the rest of his or her life.","business and economics , personal finance , retirement planning"

(catching people doing things right). in whale done!, ken blanchard shows how to make accentuating the positive and redirecting the negative the best tools to increase productivity, instead of creating situations that demoralize people. these techniques are remarkably easy to master and can be applied equally well at home, allowing readers to become better parents and more committed spouses in their happier and more successful personal lives.","business and economics , management"

""long term benefits, like pension plans,"" pollan reminds readers, ""are worthless.  most of you will be fired long before you are fully vested.""  what else is keeping people locked in the 20th century?  two little pieces of plastic:  atm cards and credit cards.  the convenience is irresistible; the costs are mind-boggling.  offering a strong dose of reality, pollan insists that spending should be difficult and uncomfortable:  ""you must resolve to no longer reach beyond your grasp.  if you don't have the cash on hand or in your checking account to buy something... don't buy it.""pollan issues an equally important warning about the biggest purchase most people make in their lives -- real estate.  home-ownership remains an excellent tax shelter and a desirable form of enforced savings that can help generate income in later years.  but with the unpredictability of the real estate market, the benefits of ""serial ownership,"" or ""trading up,"" have become less likely.  pollan's solution is to save your money until you can ""buy your second home first,"" by purchasing a residence that is large enough to accommodate a growing family, aging parents and even a home business -- in short, a home designed for a lifetime.  along with demanding a new perspective on work, credit and real estate, the new economic age lays to rest the american ""dream"" of retirement.  not only are traditional sources of retirement money (government assistance and private pensions) drying up, but people have discovered that long-term leisure isn't all it's cracked up to be.  pollan encourages readers to shift their viewpoint and think about earned income the way they've always thought about unearned income: it may grow, stagnate or decrease.  investing and savings should be used to generate unearned income that will supplement on-going but fluctuating earnings.  among his recommendations: keep a liquid reserve (in certificates of deposit, for example), pile up tax free savings by taking full advantage of iras, keoghs, seps or 401(k)s, stick with equity investments like stock mutual funds far longer than traditionalists recommend, insure your income with top-notch health and disability coverage and protect your family with term life insurance that gives them enough to get by so they can adjust to the loss of your income.  there's one last obstacle to living well now and in the future: the obsession with inheritance.  like retirement, the desire to establish an estate is a hold-over from an earlier age and leads to unnecessary sacrifices that far outweigh any future benefits.  asserting that ""every dollar that's left in your bank account after you die is a dollar wasted,""  pollan outlines a plan that enables you to die broke while guaranteeing that you don't out-live your assets.  his plan includes what kind of annuities to invest in for a maximum flow of income, the best ways to share your money with loved ones while you're still alive, how to get paid for living in your house and the ins-and-outs of medicaid, medigap, long-term care  insurance and other vehicles for covering expenses at the end of life1s journey.   recognizing that accepting a theory is one thing and putting it into practice another, pollan provides an invaluable examination of 63 different career and financial topics from the die broke  perspective.  throughout the book, pollan specifies the optimum times to pursue various financial options, but stresses that it is possible to go back and accomplish most objectives before moving on to the next phase or to hold off on a step until you meet the criteria he discusses.  the good news is it's never too early and never too late to live well and die broke.","business and economics , personal finance , general"

902,george soros on globalization,george soros,"over the past decade, ""globalization"" has become a buzzword for everything that is happening in the world economy or even in international relations generally. but as even a cursory glance at recent headlines reveals, not everyone is happy with globalization. violent protests are now a regular feature of international summit meetings, and many young people have expressed their strong opposition to policies that they see as enriching the rich at the expense of workers, the environment, and traditional culture.  as the world economy has transformed in the 1990s and early 2000s, no individual has grappled with the social and political implications of globalization more than george soros. george soros on globalization seeks to assess not merely how well the world's financial institutions have fulfilled their larger mission of helping the entire world strive for prosperity, but also to point the way toward fixing the problems that have emerged in the globalization regime as a whole. unlike other proponents of globalization, soros does not dismiss the criticisms of the protesters; indeed, he welcomes them and acknowledges that in many ways the protesters have a clearer view of the issues at stake than the bankers and bureaucrats do. we ignore the protesters' message, soros warns, at our peril.","business and economics , economics , general"

947,working under different rules (a national bureau of economic research project report),richard b. freeman,"for much of the 20th century, american workers were the world's leaders in productivity, wages, and positive workplace conditions. american unions championed free enterprise and high labor standards, and american businesses dominated the world market. but, as editor richard b. freeman cautions in working under different rules, despite our relatively high standard of living we have fallen behind our major trading partners and competitors in providing good jobs at good pay—what was once considered ""the american dream."" working under different rules assesses the decline in the well-being of american workers—evidenced by spiraling income inequality and stagnant real earnings—and compares our employment and labor conditions with those of western europe, canada, japan, and australia. as these original essays demonstrate, the modern u.s. labor market is characterized by a high degree of flexibility, with rapid employee turnover, ongoing creation of new jobs, and decentralized wage setting practices. but closer inspection reveals a troubling flip side to this adaptability in the form of inadequate job training, more frequent layoffs, and increased numbers of workers pushed to the very bottom of the income scale, into the low wage occupations where much of the recent job growth has occurred. while the variety of works councils prevalent throughout the developed world have done much to foster democratic rights and economic protection for employees, the virtually union-free environment emerging in many areas of the private u.s. economy has stripped workers of a strong collective voice. german apprenticeship programs and the japanese system of ""job rotation"" represent more effective approaches to preparing workers for the changing demands of lifetime employment. in addition, workers in european advanced economies and in canada have greater social protection than americans. but while this has some cost in unemployment and higher taxes, carefully designed social safety nets do not seriously jeopardize economic efficiency. working under different rules is an illuminating analysis of the often complex interaction of market institutions, social policy, and economic results. the authors' up-to-date international assessment of unions, wage setting, apprenticeship programs, welfare support, and works councils suggests alternate ways of training, paying, and empowering workers that, if effectively adapted, could facilitate the growth of a healthier american economy and better prospects for american workers.","business and economics , labor"

1001,the new face of war: how war will be fought in the 21st century,bruce d. berkowitz,"as american and coalition troops fight the first battles of this new century -- from afghanistan to yemen to the philippines to iraq -- they do so in ways never before seen. until recently, information war was but one piece of a puzzle, more than a sideshow in war but far less than the sum total of the game. today, however, we find information war revolutionizing combat, from top to bottom. gone are the advantages of fortified positions -- nothing is impregnable any longer. gone is the reason to create an overwhelming mass of troops -- now, troop concentrations merely present easier targets. instead, stealth, swarming, and ""zapping"" (precision strikes on individuals or equipment) are the order of the day, based on superior information and lightning-fast decision-making. in many ways, modern warfare is information warfare.  bruce berkowitz's explanation of how information war revolutionized combat and what it means for our soldiers could not be better timed. as western forces wage war against terrorists and their supporters, in actions large and small, on several continents, the new face of war explains how they fight and how they will win or lose. there are four key dynamics to the new warfare: asymmetric threats, in which even the strongest armies may suffer from at least one achilles' heel; information-technology competition, in which advantages in computers and communications are crucial; the race of decision cycles, in which the first opponent to process and react to information effectively is almost certain to win; and network organization, in which fluid arrays of combat forces can spontaneously organize in multiple ways to fight any given opponent at any time.  america's use of networked, elite ground forces, in combination with precision-guided bombing from manned and unmanned flyers, turned afghanistan from a soviet graveyard into a lopsided field of american victory. yet we are not invulnerable, and the same technology that we used in kuwait in 1991 is now available to anyone with a credit card and access to the internet. al qaeda is adept in the new model of war, and has searched long and hard for weaknesses in our defenses. will we be able to stay ahead of its thinking? in iraq, saddam's army is in no position to defeat its enemies -- but could it defend baghdad? as the world anxiously considers these and other questions of modern war, bruce berkowitz offers many answers and a framework for understanding combat that will never again resemble the days of massive marches on fortress-like positions.  the new face of war is a crucial guidebook for reading the headlines from across our troubled planet.","technology and engineering , telecommunications"

1200,trappings of power: ballistic missiles in the third world,janne e. nolan,"since the beginning of the crisis precipitated by iraq's invasion of kuwait in august 1990, the threat posed by iraq's arsenal of ballistic missiles has been the focus of international attention. in the opening days of the u.s.-led military counteroffensive beginning on january 16, 1992, iraq launched ballistic missiles against population centers in israel and military bases in saudi arabia. the attacks intensified the terror of the war and prompted renewed efforts by the multinational force to destroy saddam hussein's military machine.the countries aligned against iraq were prepared for attacks by chemically armed missiles, but iraq's missile force proved to be of little military consequence. the missiles that survived the opening hours of operation desert storm were conventionally armed, inaccurate and unreliable. most of those that were actually launched either were intercepted by american antimissile defenses or failed to hit vital targets.but the political impact of the missiles was inestimable. the strikes symbolized iraq's determination to prosecute the war no matter what the cost. by threatening to involve israel, they created severe tensions and posed the risk that multinational military coalition would be dissolved, and they underscored the potential vulnerability of all the states in the region to iraqi aggression.in this book, janne e. nolan argues that the use of missiles is a harbinger of the altered international security environment confronting the untied states and its allies in the late twentieth century. long believed to be a distant prospect, the adoption of technological resources to missile development is already occurring in over a dozen developing countries, many of them long-standing regional antagonists. these capabilities present complicated challenges to american interests and foreign policy, challenges that have only begun to be explored as a result of the iraqi crisis.the author examines the evolution of the international technology market, surveys third world missile programs, and analyzes the military significance of ballistic missiles in potential third world combat. she also discusses the way in which domestic and international policy decisions are made to promote or restrain the export of military technology, and assesses the strengths and weaknesses of current policy. finally, she emphasizes the need for institutional reforms to balance the requirements of protecting the technological edge on which the united states relies for its own security against the growing pressures of international miniaturization.","technology and engineering , military science"

1204,here comes everybody: the power of organizing without organizations,clay shirky,"a revelatory examination of how the wildfirelike spread of new forms of social interaction enabled by technology is changing the way humans form groups and exist within them, with profound long-term economic and social effects-for good and for ill  a handful of kite hobbyists scattered around the world find each other online and collaborate on the most radical improvement in kite design in decades. a midwestern professor of middle eastern history starts a blog after 9/11 that becomes essential reading for journalists covering the iraq war. activists use the internet and e-mail to bring offensive comments made by trent lott and don imus to a wide public and hound them from their positions. a few people find that a world-class online encyclopedia created entirely by volunteers and open for editing by anyone, a wiki, is not an impractical idea. jihadi groups trade inspiration and instruction and showcase terrorist atrocities to the world, entirely online. a wide group of unrelated people swarms to a web site about the theft of a cell phone and ultimately goads the new york city police to take action, leading to the culprit's arrest.  with accelerating velocity, our age's new technologies of social networking are evolving, and evolving us, into new groups doing new things in new ways, and old and new groups alike doing the old things better and more easily. you don't have to have a myspace page to know that the times they are a changin'. hierarchical structures that exist to manage the work of groups are seeing their raisons d'tre swiftly eroded by the rising technological tide. business models are being destroyed, transformed, born at dizzying speeds, and the larger social impact is profound.  one of the culture's wisest observers of the transformational power of the new forms of tech-enabled social interaction is clay shirky, and here comes everybody is his marvelous reckoning with the ramifications of all this on what we do and who we are. like lawrence lessig on the effect of new technology on regimes of cultural creation, shirky's assessment of the impact of new technology on the nature and use of groups is marvelously broad minded, lucid, and penetrating; it integrates the views of a number of other thinkers across a broad range of disciplines with his own pioneering work to provide a holistic framework for understanding the opportunities and the threats to the existing order that these new, spontaneous networks of social interaction represent. wikinomics, yes, but also wikigovernment, wikiculture, wikievery imaginable interest group, including the far from savory. a revolution in social organization has commenced, and clay shirky is its brilliant chronicler.","technology and engineering , telecommunications"

1207,genius: the life and science of richard feynman,james gleick,"a genius, a great mathematician once said, performs magic, does things that nobody else could do. to his scientific colleagues, richard feynman was a magician of the highest caliber. architect of quantum theories, enfant terrible of the atomic bomb project, caustic critic of the space shuttle commission, nobel prize winner for work that gave physicists a new way of describing and calculating the interactions of subatomic particles, richard feynman left his mark on virtually every area of modern physics.originality was his obsession. never content with what he knew or with what others knew, feynman ceaselessly questioned scientific truths. but there was also another side to him, one which made him a legendary figure among scientists. his curiosity moved well beyond things scientific: he taught himself how to play drums, to give massages, to write chinese, to crack safes.in genius, james gleick, author of the acclaimed best-seller chaos, shows us a feynman few have seen. he penetrates beyond the gleeful showman depicted in feynman's own memoirs and reveals a darker feynman: his ambition, his periods of despair and uncertainty, his intense emotional nature.from his childhood on the beaches and backlots of far rockaway and his first tinkering with radios and differential equations to the machine shops at mit and the early theoretical work at princeton - work that foreshadowed his famous notion of antiparticles traveling backward in time - to the tragic death of his wife while he was working at los alamos, genius shows how one scientist's vision was formed. as that vision crystallized in work that reinvented quantum mechanics, we see feynman's impact on the elite particle-physics community, and how feynman grew to be at odds with the very community that idolized him. finally, gleick explores the nature of genius, our obsession with it and why the very idea may belong to another time.genius records the life of a scientist who has forever changed science - and changed what it means to know something in this uncertain century.","biography and autobiography , science and technology"

1212,while they're at war: the true story of american families on the homefront,kristin henderson,"kristin henderson is a journalist married to a military chaplain who has served in the persian gulf, afghanistan, and iraq. in while they're at war, she draws upon the trust she's earned from military families and her unique access to military staff to give us a ""powerful, revealing, and sometimes painful . . . look behind the scenes"" (booklist) at the modern military's untold story.we first meet marissa bootes and beth pratt, new army wives undergoing intense indoctrination on fort bragg, north carolina, while their husbands are fighting in iraq. their stories unfold to reveal often hidden aspects of life on the homefront. through gripping storytelling, we see families battling the overwhelming effects of isolation and anticipatory grief, the strongly enforced codes concerning infidelity, their feelings of alienation both from military staff and from nonmilitary citizens, and the harrowing impact of e-mail/cellphone/cnn culture. moving scenes bring to life the special struggles of children and those who teach and care for them, as well as the toll that combat exposure takes on families, especially if it erupts into homecoming violence. finally, henderson reveals the life-changing solidarity experienced in an informal support group like fort bragg's hooah wives.while they're at war is an indelible portrait, too, of virtually invisible figures such as homefront fathers raising teenagers alone. we meet the chaplains, social workers, and psychiatrists dedicated to helping military families cope. and, through henderson's brilliant reporting from walter reed army medical center's ward 57, we are given a searing view of the wounded and their families confronting changed lives.""in a country of nearly three hundred million people,"" henderson writes, ""only two and half million serve in the active duty armed forces. . . yet in our american democracy, the warriors themselves don't get to decide when [sacrifices] are to be made. civilians make that decision. it's up to our civilian congress to declare war. . . and it's up to the civilians who elect those leaders to pay attention, to make sure that the cause of the hour is worth the sacrifices being made on their behalf."" while they're at war is moving and necessary testimony for all americans, from the military families who make possible america's way of war and way of life. kristin henderson has written frequently on military issues; this book had its origins in two cover stories for the washington post magazine. she is also the author of driving by moonlight, an account of her experience during her husband's deployment to afghanistan. a practicing quaker, she is married to a navy chaplain serving with the marines and is active in the marine corps's key volunteer family readiness program.","technology and engineering , military science"
